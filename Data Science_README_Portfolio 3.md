# **Mobile price dataset - Portfolio 3**

**1. Overview**

[Mobile Price dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FBIBTsw0XGjUDbJvlkGfm0zjpWC0f_qC/view?usp=sharing)


This project utilizes a dataset of mobile phone specifications to predict their price range. By leveraging features such as RAM, battery power, screen size, and more, we build predictive models that classify phones into different price categories. This analysis helps consumers understand the factors that most significantly impact mobile phone pricing and assists manufacturers in strategically positioning their products in the market.

The data contains both numerical and categorical variables, which easily to train classification models to predict mobile phone prices ('price range' in the dataset)and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these models.

**2. Why it is useful?**
Understanding the factors that influence mobile phone prices can greatly benefit both consumers and manufacturers:

*   Consumers can make more informed decisions by understanding which features contribute to the cost of a phone.
*   Manufacturers can optimize the features of their phones to target specific market segments more effectively.
*   Retailers can tailor their inventory and marketing strategies based on popular features within certain price ranges.

**3. How Users Can Get Started with the Project?**

To begin using this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
*   Ensure you have Git installed on your computer.
*   Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Set Up the Environment and install libraries:
*   Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already.
*   Install the required Python libraries
3. Run the Analysis
*   Open the Jupyter Notebook
*   Follow the steps in the notebook to see the analysis in action.

**4. The portfolio will go through the process of:**

1. Explore the data and clean the data if necessary.

2. Study the correlation between 'price range' with other features. And select the variables that you think are helpful for predicting the price range. 

3. Split the dataset

4. Train a logistic regression model to predict 'price range' based on the selected features (from the second step). Calculate the accuracy of your model. Explain your model and evaluate its performance.

5. Train a KNN model to predict 'price range' based on the selected features (you can use the features selected from the second step and set K with an ad-hoc manner in this step. Calculate the accuracy of your model. 

6. Tune the hyper-parameter K in KNN, visualize the results, and explain how K influences the prediction performance.
