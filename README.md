**2. Why it is useful?**

Cleaning e-commerce data is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of analyses. Unclean data can lead to misleading conclusions due to errors like duplicate entries or incorrect information. By standardizing data formats and addressing missing values, data cleaning promotes consistency and completeness. This process not only enhances the efficiency of data operations by reducing unnecessary bulk but also ensures relevance by pruning data unrelated to key business insights.
